    <h1>
      About this service
    </h1>
    <p>This service lets users browse and search for different types of information standards relevant for enabling interoperability across health and social care. Standards relating to a particular use case are published in different areas and websites
      depending on the type of standard and area of expertise of those developing them, so it can be hard for users to find all the
      information they need to solve a whole problem in an interoperable way.</p>

      <p>The Standards Directory aims to make it easier for users to find the standards that are relevant to the service they are building or
        buying, without having to check all the sites that exist.</p>

        <p>This service is currently in development and going through testing and iterations. To report a problem, suggest an enhancement or
          propose a new feature, you can email the standards directory team at <a href="mailto:standards.directory@nhsx.nhs.uk">standards.directory@nhsx.nhs.uk</a></p>

          <h2>Who this service is for</h2>
          <p>Anyone building or buying digital technologies for the NHS or local authority-funded adult social care settings who need to find
            what relevant information standards they should include in the system they are building or buying. That includes IT suppliers such
            as developers and product managers, as well as care providers and buyers of systems ranging from procurement teams, clinical informatics
            specialists and framework operators.</p>

            <p>Others involved in the development of standards - such as assurance teams, regulators or standard owners and creators - can also benefit
              from increased accessibility and discoverability of standards.</p>

            <h2>What standards are covered</h2>

            <p>This service contains entries for information standards drawn from:</p>
            <ul class="nhsuk-list-bullet">
              <li>all current approved national information standards published on the
                <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/information-standards/information-standards-and-data-collections-including-extractions/publications-and-notifications/standards-and-collections#approved-standards-and-collections">NHS Digital website</a>,
                for which the Data Alliance Partnership Board (DAPB) has issued an Information Standard Notice (ISN) to announce new or changes to information standards that fall under
                section 250 of the Health and Social Care Act 2012</li>
              <li>API standards and specifications published on the <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue">NHS Digital API Catalogue</a></li>
              <li>record standards published by the <a href="https://theprsb.org/">Professional Records Standards Body (PRSB)</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>It currently excludes data collections, which may be included in the future.</p>

<p>Learn more about the types of standards and what they are for in our guidance on <a href="what">what information standards are</a>.</p>



            <h2>How this service works</h2>


            <p>The Standards Directory works as a browsable index, bringing together the different types of standards needed for interoperability so that users can find all the content and standards relevant to their use case and service type.</p>

            <p>This is a signposting service and doesnâ€™t include the full documentation for each standard, which is managed and hosted by the organisations that develop them. You can find a link to the implementation guidance and specifications for all standards in the 'About this standard' section at the top of each listing.</p>
