      <h1>Get involved with community discussions</h1>

      <p>The standards community platform is designed to help bring people together to solve issues around standards development, implementation and adoption.</p>

  <p>It is open to anyone who uses, develops, commissions, owns or assures standards, services and APIs relating to interoperable technology in health and social care.
</p>

<h2>Discussions forum on GitHub</h2>

<p>In the discussions forum, you can: </p>
<ul class="nhsuk-list-bullet">
  <li>read and comment on discussions on use cases, standards implementation and local specifications</li>
  <li>post a question or share your own experience in a new discussion</li>
</ul>

<h2>How the community platform works</h2>
<p>The platform is hosted on GitHub, an open source platform designed for collaboration.</p>
<p>You will need a <a href="https://github.com/">public GitHub account</a> if you want to comment, start a discussion or make a contribution to the standards
  community development backlog.</p>
<p>You do not need to create a GitHub account to browse and search.</p>

<h2>Support</h2>
<p>The standards directory team moderate the standards community development backlog and the discussions forum.</p>
