            <li>It’s now called ‘NHS Standards directory’ rather than ‘Open toolkit’</li>
            <li>We’ve added some examples for the search box</li>
            <li>If you add a search term and hit submit, you’ll go to a very basic page of search results with some filters</li>
            <li>The ‘Tools’ section is now called ‘Directory’</li>
            <li>We’ve swapped the position of the Guidance and Directory links, so Directory now comes first - we think the links to the tools will be by far the more used section for most users, so we want to avoid frustrating them by forcing them to scroll down every time. But having the Guidance on the second row hopefully gives it enough prominence that users looking for it will be able to see it.</li>
            <li>Some of the labels of the different sections have been tweaked</li>
            <li>The ‘Contribute’ section how has 4 sections, rather than 2</li>

          <ul class="nhs-list nhs-list-bullet">
            <li>We’ve combined the ‘Information standards’ and ‘Terminology standards’ sections into a single group called ‘Content Standards’</li>
            <li>We’ve added a section for ‘Security standards’ - but this is a placeholder and doesn’t link through to anything – it could be worth probing what users think might be in here</li>

          <ul class="nhs-list nhs-list-bullet">
            <li>We’ve added some new filters for </li>
            <li>‘Compliance’ – I.e. is the standard ‘required’ ‘recommended’ or ‘optional’</li>
            <li>’Status’ - I.e. what is the status of the standard</li>
            <li>These are both highlighted in the list of standards</li>
            <li>We will also add in the date the standard was last updated</li>

            <li>We’ve metadata for ‘compliance’ along with an explanation of what it means e.g. ‘Recommended for use on relevant services’ – it would be good to probe what they think of the description, and what would they think it should say if it was a mandated standard</li>
            <li>We’ve added related use cases and case studies near the bottom</li>
            <li>Below the ‘Previous versions’, </li>
            <li>We’ve added a link to ‘Get email updates for this standard’ where the user can provide an email address</li>
            <li>We’ve added a page last update section</li>

          <ul class="nhs-list nhs-list-bullet">
            <li>We’ve added an “API status’ filter with more simplified options, rather than ‘Alpha beta etc’– it would be good to probe if this is more understandable or it needs more detail</li>
            <li>We play back the API status on the list</li>
