      <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">How to use standards</h2>

      <p>For health and social care systems to benefit from exchanging information you need to:</p>
      <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
        <li>use standards correctly</li>
        <li>follow rules on data security</li>
        <li>agree rules on information governance</li>
        <li>ensure staff use new ways of working </li>
      </ul>


      <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-s">Using standards correctly</h3>

      <p>To ensure data is correctly exchanged, you must use content and technical standards in every system that wants to share or receive information. </p>

      <p>If the correct standards aren’t used, the data will not be exchanged or it will not render correctly at the receiving end. For example, to correctly exchange information when discharging someone from a mental health to a GP service you need: </p>

      <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
        <li>the content standard for mental health discharge to ensure the systems sending and receiving the information format it in the same way</li>
        <li>the technical standard for mental health discharge to ensure the data is structured in a way that can be exchanged</li>
      </ul>

      <p>However simply exchanging the information isn’t enough. There are also other important issues to consider. </p>

      <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-s">Following data security rules</h3>

      <p>Every organisation or supplier that has access to patient data and systems must meet minimum requirements for cyber security and data protection. These are:</p>

      <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
        <li>the Data Security and Protection Toolkit - this is an online self-assessment for organisations to measure their performance against 10 core data security principles</li>
        <li>Something else?</li>
        <li>Something else?</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-s">Agreeing rules on information governance </h3>

      <p>Before exchanging information, care settings need to agree rules around information governance. This includes deciding who will be able to see what data and agreeing a process for recording patients’ and service users’ consent. </p>

      <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-s">Changes to ways of working</h3>

      <p>For staff to be able to see information across organisational boundaries, data needs to be recorded using digital systems. If staff continue to record and share information using paper, email or fax the benefits of interoperability won’t be felt by them or the people they’re caring for. </p>

      <p>You can see how care settings in Bristol, Leeds and London engaged with their staff to change ways of working - and the benefits their staff reported once the new systems were in place. </p>


      <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Contributing to standards development</h2>

      <p>Standards don’t exist for everything services are trying to do in health and social care. In some cases content standards might exist but corresponding technical standards might not. </p>

      <p>What’s important is that where standards and APIs do exist and apply, they are used. If they don’t exist there’s an opportunity to contribute a standard or API to the community to support standardisation in that particular area.</p>

      <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Links to guidance</h2>

      <p>There’s guidance on procuring and implementing interoperable solutions in NHS England’s interoperability handbook. </p>
