      <h2 id="what" class="nhsuk-heading-m">Using standards to build interoperable services</h2>

      <p>All digital products and services should use approved standardised formats - standards - for collecting, structuring and exchanging health and social care data in England. </p>

      <p>Using these standards consistently allows IT systems and products to communicate across care settings, and for permitted staff to be able to directly access or share certain information with those settings. This is known as interoperability. </p>

      <p>There are two types of standard that form the main building blocks of interoperable digital products and services.</p>

      <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-s">Content standards</h3>

      <p>Content standards ensure information is collected and formatted consistently. They ensure information:</p>
      <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
        <li>is grouped under the same headings - ‘Person’s details’ instead of ‘Patient’s details’, for example</li>
        <li>uses the correct clinical codes - for example, recording someone’s medication using its dedicated code rather than just writing the name which can lead to errors</li>
        <li>uses data models to format information consistently - for example, </li>
      </ul>
      <p><a href="browse-information">Browse content standards</a></p>

      <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-s">Technical standards</h3>

      <p>Technical or messaging standards ensure information is structured in code in a consistent way that can be easily shared with other systems. These are often built into APIs to make them easier to implement. </p>

      <p><a href="browse-technical">Browse technical standards</a></p>

      <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-s">Services</h3>

      <p>There are also national services that allow you to access central datasets as well as use resources such as NHS Email and Wifi. Access to some of these is essential to build interoperable technology in health and social care. </p>

      <h2 id="how" class="nhsuk-heading-m">Why use standards</h2>

      <p>The use of standards and the development of interoperable services is important for the safety of people receiving care. This is because:</p>

      <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
        <li>it reduces the risk of errors  - for example, if a staff member writes down the name of someone’s medication without including the correct code it could be misread by a colleague </li>
        <li>it gives permitted health and social care professionals instant access to someone’s records - in an emergency situation this could save someone’s life</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This is why some standards are mandatory for use in all circumstances where they apply. </p>

      <p>There are also major benefits for people who give and receive care.</p>

      <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-s">Benefits to people who receive care</h3>

      <p>Benefits include:</p>
      <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
        <li>reducing the burden on people needing to share details about their health or treatment every time they receive some form of care. This can be hard for everyone, but especially for people with conditions that affect their memory.</li>
        <li>allowing people to be able to see their own health record, so they have more visibility and ownership of their data</li>
        <li>giving people more effective care by ensuring healthcare professionals make informed decisions based on their full history</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-s">Benefits to health and social care professionals</h3>

      <p>Benefits include:</p>

      <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
        <li>being able to call up someone’s health record or a snapshot of their record instantly without having to ask anyone to share it </li>
        <li>being able to see richer details about the health and wellbeing of the person they’re caring for to better tailor treatment or services</li>
        <li>less time filling in paperwork</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The recent pandemic - where we had to quickly move patients to wherever there was space to treat them - showed us how important it is to join up IT systems to make care provision easier. </p>

      <p>You can see some of the real benefits people have experienced thanks to interoperable technology in case studies for Manchester and Swindon. </p>
